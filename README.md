# House Rent Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to the House Rent Analysis and Prediction project, a comprehensive analysis and prediction solution for the rental property market. This repository offers a powerful toolkit for both understanding rental property trends and predicting future rental prices using regression techniques in machine learning.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Dive deep into the rental property dataset to gain valuable insights into market trends, pricing dynamics, and location preferences.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Ensure data accuracy and reliability through robust preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and outlier detection.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilize descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in the data.

- **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features that contribute to the predictive power of the model.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Employ various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and more, to predict rental prices accurately.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

- **Predictive Insights:** Leverage the best-performing model to make predictions on new rental property listings, enabling informed decision-making for both tenants and landlords.
